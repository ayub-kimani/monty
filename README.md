# Monty

`monty` is an interpreter of Monty ByteCodes files.

## About the Monty language
This language contains specific instructions to manipulate data information (stacks or queues), where each instruction (*called opcode*) is sent per line. Files which contains Monty byte codes usually have the `.m` extension.

## Technologies
* Interpreter was written with C language
* Vi Editor
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

| `mul` | Multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack |
| `div` | Divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack |
| `mod` | Computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack |
| `pchar` | Prints the char at the top of the stack |
